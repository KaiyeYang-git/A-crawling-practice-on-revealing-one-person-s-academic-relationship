Shum" "Zhanxing Zhu"    "Spatio-temporal Manifold Learning for Human Motions via Long-horizon Modeling" "Data-driven modeling of human motions is ubiquitous in computer graphics and computer vision applications, such as synthesizing realistic motions or recognizing actions. Recent research has shown that such problems can be approached by learning a natural motion manifold using deep learning on a large amount data, to address the shortcomings of traditional data-driven approaches. However, previous deep learning methods can be sub-optimal for two reasons. First, the skeletal information has not been fully utilized for feature extraction. Unlike images, it is difficult to define spatial proximity in skeletal motions in the way that deep networks can be applied for feature extraction. Second, motion is time-series data with strong multi-modal temporal correlations between frames. On the one hand, a frame could be followed by several candidate frames leading to different motions; on the other hand, long-range dependencies exist where a number of frames in the beginning correlate to a number of frames later.  Ineffective temporal modeling would either under-estimate the multi-modality and variance, resulting in featureless mean motion or over-estimate them resulting in jittery motions, which is a major source of visual artifacts. In this paper, we propose a new deep network to tackle these challenges by creating a natural motion manifold that is versatile for many applications. The network has a new spatial component for feature extraction. It is also equipped with a new batch prediction model that predicts a large number of frames at once, such that long-term temporally-based objective functions can be employed to correctly learn the motion multi-modality and variances. With our system, long-duration motions can be predicted/synthesized using an open-loop setup where the motion retains the dynamics accurately. It can also be used for denoising corrupted motions and synthesizing new motions with given control signals. We demonstrate that our system can create superior results comparing to existing work in multiple applications."

However, it has limited capacity in modeling the complex spatial relationship in the human skeletal structure. In this work, we present a novel diffusion convolutional recurrent predictor for spatial and temporal movement forecasting, with multi-step random walks traversing bidirectionally along an adaptive graph to model interdependency among body joints. In the temporal domain, existing methods rely on a single forward predictor with the produced motion deflecting to the drift route, which leads to error accumulations over time. We propose to supplement the forward predictor with a forward discriminator to alleviate such motion drift in the long term under adversarial training. The solution is further enhanced by a backward predictor and a backward discriminator to effectively reduce the error, such that the system can also look into the past to improve the prediction at early frames. The two-way spatial diffusion convolutions and two-way temporal predictors together form a quadruple network. Furthermore, we train our framework by modeling the velocity from observed motion dynamics instead of static poses to predict future movements that effectively reduces the discontinuity problem at early prediction. Our method outperforms the state of the arts on both 3D and 2D datasets, including the Human3.6M, CMU Motion Capture and Penn Action datasets. The results also show that our method correctly predicts both high-dynamic and low-dynamic moving trends with less motion drift."

However, synthesizing such reactive motions in human-human interactions is a challenging task due to the many different ways two humans can interact. While there are a number of successful researches in adapting the generative adversarial network (GAN) in synthesizing single human actions, there are very few on modelling human-human interactions. In this paper, we propose a semi-supervised GAN system that synthesizes the reactive motion of a character given the active motion from another character. Our key insights are two-fold. First, to effectively encode the complicated spatial-temporal information of a human motion, we empower the generator with a part-based long short-term memory (LSTM) module, such that the temporal movement of different limbs can be effectively modelled. We further include an attention module such that the temporal significance of the interaction can be learned, which enhances the temporal alignment of the active-reactive motion pair. Second, as the reactive motion of different types of interactions can be significantly different, we introduce a discriminator that not only tells if the generated movement is realistic or not, but also tells the class label of the interaction. This allows the use of such labels in supervising the training of the generator. We experiment with the SBU and the HHOI datasets. The high quality of the synthetic motion demonstrates the effective design of our generator, and the discriminability of the synthesis also demonstrates the strength of our discriminator."

In computer animation, both body motions and facial expressions are two popular mediums for a character to express the emotion. However, there has been limited research in studying how to effectively synthesize these two types of character movements using different levels of emotion strength with intuitive control, which is difficult to be modelled effectively. In this work, we explore a common model that can be used to represent the emotion for the applications of body motions and facial expressions synthesis. Unlike previous work which encode emotions into discrete motion style descriptors, we propose a continuous control indicator called emotion strength, by controlling which a data-driven approach is presented to synthesize motions with fine control over emotions. Rather than interpolating motion features to synthesize new motion as in existing work, our method explicitly learns a model mapping low-level motion features to the emotion strength. Since the motion synthesis model is learned in the training stage, the computation time required for synthesizing motions at run-time is very low. We further demonstrate the generality of our proposed framework by editing 2D face images using relative emotion strength. As a result, our method can be applied to interactive applications such as computer games, image editing tools and virtual reality applications, as well as offline applications such as animation and movie production.

We propose a system to automatically generate sign dance from a piece of music and its corresponding sign gesture. The core of the system is a Sign Dance Model trained by multiple regression analysis to represent the correlations between sign dance and sign gesture/music, as well as a set of objective functions to evaluate the quality of the sign dance.

Human dance performances typically require expert knowledge of dance choreography and professional rehearsal, which are too costly for casual entertainment venues and clubs. Recent advancements in character animation and motion synthesis have made it possible to synthesize virtual 3D dance characters in real-time. The major problem in existing systems is a lack of an intuitive interfaces to control the animation for real-time dance controls. We propose a new system called the DanceDJ to solve this problem. Our system consists of two parts. The first part is an underlying motion analysis system that evaluates motion features including dance features such as the postures and movement tempo, as well as audio features such as the music tempo and structure. As a pre-process, given a dancing motion database, our system evaluates the quality of possible timings to connect and switch different dancing motions. During run-time, we propose a control interface that provides visual guidance. We observe that disk jockeys (DJs) effectively control the mixing of music using the DJ controller, and therefore propose a DJ controller for controlling dancing characters. This allows DJs to transfer their skills from music control to dance control using a similar hardware setup. We map different motion control functions onto the DJ controller, and visualize the timing of natural connection points, such that the DJ can effectively govern the synthesized dance motion. We conducted two user experiments to evaluate the user experience and the quality of the dance character. Quantitative analysis shows that our system performs well in both motion control and simulation quality."

While there are mature techniques to generate primary deformation from skeletal movement, simulating realistic and stable secondary deformation such as jiggling of fats remains challenging. On one hand, traditional volumetric approaches such as the finite element method require higher computational cost and are infeasible for limited hardware such as game consoles. On the other hand, while shape matching based simulations can produce plausible deformation in real-time, they suffer from a stiffness problem in which particles either show unrealistic deformation due to high gains, or cannot catch up with the body movement. In this paper, we propose a unified multi-layer lattice model to simulate the primary and secondary deformation of skeleton-driven characters. The core idea is to voxelize the input character mesh into multiple anatomical layers including the bone, muscle, fat and skin. Primary deformation is applied on the bone voxels with lattice-based skinning. The movement of these voxels is propagated to other voxel layers using lattice shape matching simulation, creating a natural secondary deformation. Our multi-layer lattice framework can produce simulation quality comparable to those from other volumetric approaches with a significantly smaller computational cost. It is best to be applied in real-time applications such as console games or interactive animation creation.

The major difficulty is that the user has to edit individual joints while maintaining an overall realistic and collision free posture. Previous research suggests the use of data-driven inverse kinematics, such that one can focus on the control of a few joints, while the system automatically composes a natural posture. However, as a common problem of kinematics synthesis, penetration of body parts is difficult to avoid in complex movements. In this paper, we propose a new data-driven inverse kinematics framework that conserves the topology of the synthesizing postures. Our system monitors and regulates the topology changes using the Gauss Linking Integral (GLI), such that penetration can be efficiently prevented. As a result, complex motions with tight body movements, as well as those involving interaction with external objects, can be simulated with minimal manual intervention. Experimental results show that using our system, the user can create high quality human motion in real-time by controlling a few joints using a mouse or a multi-touch screen.

Although there are heavy demands in the gaming and animation industries, no systemic solution has been proposed due to the difficulties to model the complex behaviors of the characters.We represent the continuous interactions among characters as a discrete Markov Decision Process, and design a general objective function to evaluate the immediate rewards of launching an action. By applying game theory such as tree expansion and min-max search, the optimal actions that benefit the character the most in the future are selected. The simulated characters can interact competitively while achieving the requests from animators cooperatively.Since the interactions between two characters depend on a lot of criteria, it is difficult to exhaustively precompute the optimal actions for all variations of these criteria. We design an off-policy approach that samples and precomputes only meaningful interactions. With the precomputed policy, the optimal movements under different situations can be evaluated in real-time.To simulate the interactions for a large number of characters with minimal computational overhead, we propose a method to precompute short durations of interactions between two characters as connectable patches. The patches are concatenated spatially to generate interactions with multiple characters, and temporally to generate longer interactions. Based on the optional instructions given by the animators, our system automatically applies concatenations to create a huge scene of interacting crowd.We demonstrate our system by creating scenes with high quality interactions. On one hand, our algorithm can automatically generate artistic scenes of interactions such as the fighting scenes in movies that involve hundreds of characters. On the other hand, it can create controllable, intelligent characters that interact with the opponents for real-time applications such as 3D computer games."

Such a module is needed to control non-player characters (NPCs) to fight, play team sports or move through a mass crowd. Reinforcement learning is an approach to achieve real-time optimal control. However, the huge state space of human interactions makes it difficult to apply existing learning methods to control avatars when they have dense interactions with other characters. In this research, we propose a new methodology to ef?ciently plan the movements of an avatar interacting with another. We make use of the fact that the subspace of meaningful interactions is much smaller than the whole state space of two avatars. We efficiently collect samples by exploring the subspace where dense interactions between the avatars occur and favor samples that have high connectivity with the other samples. Using the collected samples, a ?nite state machine (FSM) called Interaction Graph is composed. At run-time, we compute the optimal action of each avatar by min-max search or dynamic programming on the Interaction Graph. The methodology is applicable to control NPCs in ?ghting and ball-sports games."

Deep learning has shown promising results in biomedical engineering thanks to its capacity of modelling complicated data with its non-linear architecture. However, due to their complex structure, deep learning models are generally not interpretable by humans, making it difficult for clinicians to rely on the findings. In this paper, we propose a channel attention module for deep learning models to predict cerebral palsy from infants' body movements, which highlights the key features (i.e. body joints) the model identifies as important, thereby indicating why certain diagnostic results are found. To highlight the capacity of the deep network in modelling input features, we utilize raw joint positions instead of hand-crafted features. We validate our system with a real-world infant movement dataset. Our proposed channel attention module enables the visualization of the vital joints to this disease that the network considers.

There is little success in adapting interaction-based features in activity comparison, as they either do not have a fixed topology or are in high dimensional. In this paper, we propose a unified framework for activity comparison from the interaction point of view. Our new metric evaluates the similarity of interaction by adapting the Earth Mover's Distance onto a customized geometric mesh structure that represents spatial-temporal interactions. This allows us to compare different classes of interactions and discover their intrinsic semantic similarity. We created five interaction databases of different natures, covering both two-characters (synthetic and real-people) and character-object interactions, which are open for public uses. We demonstrate how the proposed metric aligns well with the semantic meaning of the interaction. We also apply the metric in interaction retrieval and show how it outperforms existing ones.

In this chapter, we evaluate such a system for the use in motion analysis in work conditions, and propose software algorithms to enhance the tracking accuracy. Firstly, we highlighted the high performance of the system when used under the recommended setup without occlusions.

Secondly, we propose a software algorithm to adapt the system to challenging conditions with occlusions to enhance the robustness and accuracy.

These results show that such adapted systems could be used to support the ergonomists work by providing them with reproducible and objective information about the human movement.

In this paper, we propose an automatic framework for classifying musculoskeletal and neurological disorders among older people based on 3D motion data.

To optimize the classification performance, we adapt feature selection methods to choose an optimal feature set from the raw feature input. Experimental results show that we achieve a classification accuracy of 84.29% using the proposed relative joint features, outperforming existing features that focus on the movement of individual joints.

They are now no longer confined to the classroom walls, but are available to anyone connected to the internet. E-learning has opened massive opportunities for learners who otherwise would have been constrained due to geographical distances, time and/or cost factors. It has revolutionized the learning methods and represents a paradigm shift from traditional learning methods. However, despite all its advantages, e-learning is not without its own shortcomings. Understanding the effectiveness of a teaching strategy through learner feedback has been a key performance measure and decision making criteria to fine tune the teaching strategy. However, traditional methods of collecting learner feedback are inadequate in a geographically distributed, virtual setup of the e-learning environment. Innovative and novel learner feedback collection mechanism is hence the need of the hour. In this work, we design and develop a deep learning based student feedback prediction system by recognizing the subtle facial motions during a student’s learning activity. This allows the system to infer the needs of the learners as if it is a realhuman teacher in order to provide the appropriate feedback. We propose a recurrent convolutional neural network structure to understand the color and depth streams of video taken by an RGB-D camera. Experimental results have shown that our system achieve high accuracy in estimating the feedback labels. While we demonstrate the proposed framework in an e-learning setup, it can be adapted to other applications such as in-house patient monitoring and rehabilitation training.

However, inverse dynamics requires accurate motion capture data, which are generally not available in real manufacturing plants. Markerless and calibrationless measurement systems based on depth cameras, such as the Microsoft Kinect, are promising means to measure 3D poses in real time. Recent works have proposed methods to obtain reliable continuous skeleton data in cluttered environments, with occlusions and inappropriate sensor placement. In this paper, we evaluate the reliability of an inverse dynamics method based on this corrected skeleton data and its potential use to estimate joint torques and forces in such cluttered environments. To this end, we compared the calculated joint torques with those obtained with a reference inverse dynamics method based on an optoelectronic motion capture system. Results show that the Kinect skeleton data enabled the inverse dynamics process to deliver reliable joint torques in occlusion-free (r = 0.99 for the left shoulder elevation) and occluded (r = 0.91 for the left shoulder elevation) environments. However, differences remain between joint torques estimations.

Being marker-free and calibration-free, Microsoft Kinect is a promising device to assess these poses, but it can deliver unreliable poses especially when occlusions occur. To overcome this problem, we propose to detect badly recognized body parts and to replace them by an appropriate combination of example poses gathered in a pre-recorded pose. The main contribution of this work is to organize the database as a filtered pose graph structure that enables the system to select relevant candidates for the combination: candidates that ensure continuity with the previous pose and similarity with the available reliable information. We applied the proposed method in a realistic environment that involved sub-optimal Kinect placement and several types of occlusions. An optoelectronic motion capture system was concurrently used to obtain ground truth joint angles. In an ergonomics context, we also computed Rapid Upper Limb Assessment RULA scores. This kind of ergonomics tool requires to rate the pose of the worker based on an estimation of the joint angles. These latter are then used to provide a global risk score. Results showed that when occlusions occur, the inaccurate raw Kinect data could be significantly improved using our correction method, leading to acceptable joint angles. As RULA calculation is based on angular thresholds, which tends to minimize the effect of joint angle errors, when these error values are not close to thresholds. However, for realistic scenarios with occlusions that lead to very large joint angle errors, the correction method also provided significantly better RULA scores.

Existing works are mainly designed to classify single human action. Many of them simply stack the movement features of two characters to deal with human interaction, while neglecting the abundant relationships between characters. In this paper, we propose a novel two-stream recurrent neural network by adopting the geometric features from both single actions and interactions to describe the spatial correlations with different discriminative abilities. The first stream is constructed under pairwise joint distance (PJD) in a fully-connected mesh to categorize the interactions with explicit distance patterns. To better distinguish similar interactions, in the second stream, we combine PJD with the spatial features from individual joint positions using graph convolutions to detect the implicit correlations among joints, where the joint connections in graph is adaptive for flexible correlations.

To take advantage of the diverse discriminative power of the two streams, we come up with a late fusion algorithm to combine their output predictions concerning information entropy.

As a result, producing such models with minimal labour costs is increasingly more important. To tackle the challenge, we propose a novel system to reconstruct a 3D car using a single sketch image. The system learns from a synthetic database of 3D car models and their corresponding 2D contour sketches and segmentation masks, allowing effective training with minimal data collection cost. The core of the system is a machine learning pipeline that combines the use of a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) and lazy learning. GAN, being a deep learning method, is capable of modelling complicated data distributions, enabling the effective modelling of a large variety of cars. Its major weakness is that as a global method, modelling the fine details in the local region is challenging. Lazy learning works well to preserve local features by generating a local subspace with relevant data samples. We demonstrate that the combined use of GAN and lazy learning produces is able to produce high-quality results, in which different types of cars with complicated local features can be generated effectively with a single sketch.

The ability to estimate depth from a single omnidirectional image can benefit applications such as robotics navigation and virtual reality. However, existing depth estimation approaches produce sub-optimal results on real-world omnidirectional images with dynamic foreground objects. On the one hand, capture-based methods cannot obtain the foreground due to the limitations of the scanning and stitching schemes. On the other hand, it is challenging for synthesis-based methods to generate highly-realistic virtual foreground objects that are comparable to the real-world ones. In this paper, we propose to augment datasets with realistic foreground objects using an image-based approach, which produces a foreground-aware photorealistic dataset for machine learning algorithms. By exploiting a novel scale-invariant RGB-D correspondence in the spherical domain, we repurpose abundant non-omnidirectional datasets to include realistic foreground objects with correct distortions. We further propose a novel auxiliary deep neural network to estimate both the depth of the omnidirectional images and the mask of the foreground objects, where the two tasks facilitate each other. A new local depth loss considers small regions of interests and ensures that their depth estimations are not smoothed out during the global gradient’s optimization. We demonstrate the system using human as the foreground due to its complexity and contextual importance, while the framework can be generalized to any other foreground objects. Experimental results demonstrate more consistent global estimations and more accurate local estimations compared with state-of-the-arts.

The major problem of Kinect is the placement requirement to obtain accurate poses, as well as its weakness against occlusions. To improve the robustness of Kinect in interactive motion-based applications, real-time data-driven pose reconstruction has been proposed. The idea is to utilize a database of accurately captured human poses as a prior to optimize the Kinect recognized ones, in order to estimate the true poses performed by the user. The key research problem is to identify the most relevant poses in the database for accurate and efficient reconstruction. In this paper, we propose a new pose reconstruction method based on modelling the pose database with a structure called Filtered Pose Graph, which indicates the intrinsic correspondence between poses. Such a graph not only speeds up the database poses selection process, but also improves the relevance of the selected poses for higher quality reconstruction. We apply the proposed method in a challenging environment of industrial context that involves sub-optimal Kinect placement and a large amount of occlusion.

However, it is still challenging to accurately recognize postures from a single depth camera due to the inherently noisy data derived from depth images and self-occluding action performed by the user. In this paper, we propose a new real-time probabilistic framework to enhance the accuracy of live captured postures that belong to one of the action classes in the database. We adopt the Gaussian Process model as a prior to leverage the position data obtained from Kinect and marker-based motion capture system. We also incorporate a temporal consistency term into the optimization framework to constrain the velocity variations between successive frames. To ensure that the reconstructed posture resembles the accurate parts of the observed posture, we embed a set of joint reliability measurements into the optimization framework. A major drawback of Gaussian Process is its cubic learning complexity when dealing with a large database due to the inverse of a covariance matrix. To solve the problem, we propose a new method based on a local mixture of Gaussian Processes, in which Gaussian Processes are defined in local regions of the state space. Due to the significantly decreased sample size in each local Gaussian Process, the learning time is greatly reduced. At the same time, the prediction speed is enhanced as the weighted mean prediction for a given sample is determined by the nearby local models only. Our system also allows incrementally updating a specific local Gaussian Process in real time, which enhances the likelihood of adapting to run-time postures that are different from those in the database.

Utilizing a pattern recognition algorithm, Kinect can determine the positions of different body parts from the user. However, due to the use of a single depth camera, recognition accuracy drops significantly when the parts are occluded. This hugely limits the usability of applications that involves interaction with external objects, such as sport training or exercising systems. The problem becomes more critical when Kinect incorrectly perceives the body parts. This is because applications have limited information about the recognition correctness, and using those parts to synthesize a body postures would result in serious visual artifacts. In this paper, we propose a new method to reconstruct valid movement from incomplete and noisy postures captured by Kinect. We first design a set of measurements that objectively evaluates the degree of reliability on each tracked body part. By incorporating the reliability estimation into a motion database query during run-time, we obtain a set of similar postures that are kinematically valid. These postures are used to construct a latent space, which is known as the natural posture space in our system, with local Principle Component Analysis (PCA). We finally apply frame-based optimization in the space to synthesize a new posture that closely resembles the true user posture while satisfying kinematic constraints.

Applications such as human behaviour analysis and workspace ergonomics monitoring are automated, thereby improving well-being of individuals with minimal running cost. The central problem of smart environments is to understand what the user is doing in order to provide the appropriate support. While it is difficult to obtain information of full body movement in the past, depth camera-based motion sensing technology such as Kinect has made it possible to obtain 3D posture without complex setup. This has fused a large number of research projects to apply Kinect in smart environments. The common bottleneck of these researches is the high amount of errors in the detected joint positions, which would result in inaccurate analysis and false alarms. In this paper, we propose a framework that accurately classifies the nature of the 3D postures obtained by Kinect using a max-margin classifier. Different from previous work in the area, we integrate the information about the reliability of the tracked joints in order to enhance the accuracy and robustness of our framework. As a result, apart from general classifying activity of different movement context, our proposed method can classify the subtle differences between correctly performed and incorrectly performed movement in the same context. We demonstrate how our framework can be applied to evaluate the user??s posture and identify the postures that may result in musculoskeletal disorders. Such a system can be used in workplace such as offices and factories to reduce risk of injury. Experimental results have shown that our method consistently outperforms existing algorithms in both activity classification and posture healthiness classification.

Human action recognition is a challenging task as the articulated action data is high dimensional in both spatial and temporal domains. An effective approach to handle this complexity is to divide human body into different body parts according to human skeletal joint positions, and performs recognition based on these part-based feature descriptors. Since different types of features could share some similar hidden structures, and different actions may be well characterized by properties common to all features (sharable structure) and those specific to a feature (specific structure), we propose a joint group sparse regression-based learning method to model each action. Our method can mine the sharable and specific structures among its part-based multiple features meanwhile imposing the importance of these part-based feature structures by joint group sparse regularization, in favor of discriminative part-based feature structure selection. To represent the dynamics and appearance of the human body parts, we employ part-based multiple features extracted from skeleton and depth data respectively. Then, using the group sparse regularization techniques, we have derived an algorithm for mining the key part-based features in the proposed learning framework. The resulting features derived from the learnt weight matrices are more discriminative for multi-task classification. Through extensive experiments on three public datasets, we demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing methods."

Such complex characteristics make the processing of motion capture data a non-trivial task. Hence, techniques that can provide an approximated, less complicated representation of such data are highly desirable. In this paper, we propose a novel technique that uses temporal clustering to generate an approximate representation of motion capture data. First, we segment the motion in the time domain with an optimal partition algorithm so that the within-segment sum of squared error (WSSSE) is minimized. Then, we represent the motion capture data as the averages taken over all the segments, resulting in a representation of much lower complexity. Experimental results suggest that comparing with the state-of-the-art methods, our proposed representation technique can better approximate the motion capture data."

Euclidean distance between corresponding joints has been widely adopted in measuring similarity of postures and hence motions. However, such a measure does not necessarily conform to the human perception of motion similarity. In this paper, we propose a new similarity measure based on machine learning techniques. We make use of the results of questionnaires from subjects answering whether arbitrary pairs of motions appear similar or not. Using the relative distance between the joints as the basic features, we train the system to compute the similarity of arbitrary pair of motions. Experimental results show that our method outperforms methods based on Euclidean distance between corresponding joints. Our method is applicable to content-based motion retrieval of human motion for large-scale database systems.

In this paper, we are going to find repetitive patterns in a given motion signal without prior knowledge about the type of motion. It is relatively easier to find repetitive patterns in discrete signal that contains a limited number of states by dynamic programming. However, it is impractical to identify exactly matched states in a continuous signal such as captured human motion data. A point cloud similarity of the input motion signal itself is considered and the longest similar patterns are located by tracing and extending matched posture pairs.

While saliency detection and shape matching are two closely related and fundamental tasks in shape analysis, previous methods approach them separately and independently, failing to exploit their mutually beneficial underlying relationship. In view of the existing gap between saliency and matching, we propose to solve them together using a unified metric representation of surface meshes. We show that saliency and matching can be rigorously derived from our representation as the principal eigenvector and the smoothed Laplacian eigenvectors respectively. Learning the representation jointly allows matching to improve the deformation-invariance of saliency while allowing saliency to improve the feature localization of matching. To parameterize the representation from a mesh, we also propose a deep recurrent neural network (RNN) for effectively integrating multi-scale shape features and a soft-thresholding operator for adaptively enhancing the sparsity of saliency. Results show that by jointly learning from a pair of saliency and matching datasets, matching improves the accuracy of detected salient regions on meshes, which is especially obvious for small-scale saliency datasets, such as those having one to two meshes. At the same time, saliency improves the accuracy of shape matchings among meshes with reduced matching errors on surfaces.

The salient regions of a mesh are those that geometrically stand out from their contexts and therefore are semantically important for geometry processing and shape analysis. However, a suitable definition of region contexts for saliency detection remains elusive in the field, and the previous methods fail to produce saliency maps that agree well with human annotations. We address these issues by computing saliency in a global manner and enforcing sparsity for more accurate saliency detection. Specifically, we represent the geometry of a mesh using a metric that globally en- codes the shape distances between every pair of local regions. We then propose a sparsity-enforcing rarity optimization problem, solving which allows us to obtain a compact set of salient regions globally distinct from each other. We build a perceptually motivated 3D eye fixation dataset and use a large-scale Schelling saliency dataset for extensive benchmarking of saliency detection methods. The results show that our computed saliency maps are closer to the ground-truth. To showcase the usefulness of our saliency maps for geometry processing, we apply them to feature point localization and achieve higher accuracy compared to established feature detectors."

However, the virtual clothing fit evaluation is still under-researched. In the literature, the thickness of the air layer between the human body and clothes is a dominant geometric indicator to evaluate the clothing fit. However, such an approach has only been applied to the stationary positions of the manikin/human body. Physical indicators such as the pressure/tension of a virtual garment fitted on the virtual body in a continuous motion are also proposed for clothing fit evaluation. Both geometric and physical evaluations do not consider the interaction of the garment with body e.g. sliding of the garment along the human body. In this study, a new framework is proposed to automatically determine the dynamic air gap thickness. First, the dynamic dressed character sequence is simulated in a 3D clothing software via importing the body parameters, cloth parameters and a walking motion. Second, a cost function is defined to convert the garment in the previous frame to the local coordinate of the next frame. The dynamic air gap thickness between clothes and the human body is determined. Third, a new metric called 3D garment vector field (3DGVF) is proposed to represent the movement flow of the dynamic virtual garment, whose directional changes are calculated by cosine similarity. Experimental results show that our method is more sensitive to the small air gap thickness changes compared with start-of-the-arts, allowing it to more effectively evaluate clothing fit in a virtual environment."

Linear subspaces such as the popular SMPL model have a limited capacity to represent the large geometric variations of human shapes and poses. What is worse is that random sampling from them often produces non-realistic humans because the distribution of real humans is more likely to concentrate on a non-linear manifold instead of the full subspace. Towards this problem, we propose to learn human shape and pose manifolds using a more powerful deep generator network, which is trained to produce samples that cannot be distinguished from real humans by a deep discriminator network. In contrast to previous work that learn both the generator and discriminator in the original geometry spaces, we learn them in the more representative latent spaces discovered by a shape and a pose auto-encoder network respectively. Random sampling from our priors produces higher-quality human shapes and poses. The capacity of our priors is best applied to applications such as virtual human synthesis in games."

Although existing methods can recover hand pose competently, the tremor issue occurring in hand motion has not been completely solved. Tremor is an involuntary motion accompanied by a desired gesture or hand motion, leading to hand pose that deviates from user’s intentions. Considering the characteristic of tremor motion, we present a novel Graph Neural Network for stable 3D hand pose estimation. The input is depth images. The constraint adjacency matrix is devised in Graph Neural Network for dynamically adjusting the topology of a hand graph during message passing and aggregation. Firstly, since there are rich potential constraints among hand joints, we utilize the constraint adjacency matrix to mine the suitable topology, modeling spatial-temporal constraints of joints and outputting the precise tremor hand pose as the pre-estimation result. Then, for obtaining a stable hand pose, we provide a tremor compensation module based on the constraint adjacency matrix, which exploits the constraint between control points and tremor hand pose. Concretely, the control points represented the voluntary motion are employed as constraints to edit the tremor hand pose. Our extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments show that the proposed method has achieved decent performance for 3D tremor hand pose estimation.

However, raw captured hand motion data always contains errors such as joints occlusion, dislocation, high-frequency noise, and involuntary jitter. Denoising and obtaining the hand motion data consistent with the user’s intention are of the utmost importance to enhance the interactive experience in MR. To this end, we propose an end-to-end method for hand motion denoising using the spatial-temporal graph auto-encoder (STGAE). The spatial and temporal patterns are recognized simultaneously by constructing the consecutive hand joint sequence as a spatial-temporal graph. Considering the complexity of the articulated hand structure, a simple yet effective partition strategy is proposed to model the physic-connected and symmetry-connected relationships. Graph convolution is applied to extract structural constraints of the hand, and a self-attention mechanism is to adjust the graph topology dynamically. Combining graph convolution and temporal convolution, a fundamental graph encoder or decoder block is proposed. We finally establish the hourglass residual auto-encoder to learn a manifold projection operation and a corresponding inverse projection through stacking these blocks. In this work, the proposed framework has been successfully used in hand motion data denoising with preserving structural constraints between joints.

Enhancing physical in-hand objects with a virtual appearance is a key component for many applications that require users to interact with tools such as surgery simulations. However, due to complex hand articulations and severe hand-object occlusions, resolving occlusions in hand-object interactions is a challenging topic. Traditional tracking-based approaches are limited by strong ambiguities from occlusions and changing shapes, while reconstruction-based methods show poor capability of handling dynamic scenes. In this paper, we propose a novel real-time optimization system to resolve hand-object occlusions by spatially reconstructing the scene with estimated hand joints and masks. To acquire accurate results, we propose a joint learning process that shares information between two models and jointly estimates hand poses and semantic segmentation. To facilitate the joint learning system and improve its accuracy under occlusions, we propose an occlusion-aware RGB-D hand dataset that mitigates the ambiguity through precise annotations and photorealistic appearance.

By enhancing existing objects with virtual visual appearance, tactile feedback can be provided to the user as well.

The system first recognizes the user control signal with a small buffer to minimize the time lag. When more signals arrive from the sensor, an elaborate recognition is performed, and the previously recognized action is switched if necessary. Using boxing as an example, we show that we can control a virtual character to perform 13 different actions using a buffer size of one-tenth of a second.

Although hand geometry recognition provides adequate security over unauthorized access, it is susceptible to presentation attack. This paper presents an anti-spoofing method toward hand biometrics. A presentation attack detection approach is addressed by assessing the visual quality of genuine and fake hand images. A threshold-based gradient magnitude similarity quality metric is proposed to discriminate between the real and spoofed hand samples. The visual hand images of 255 subjects from the Bogazici University hand database are considered as original samples. Correspondingly, from each genuine sample, we acquire a forged image using a Canon EOS 700D camera. Such fake hand images with natural degradation are considered for electronic screen display based spoofing attack detection. Furthermore, we create another fake hand dataset with artificial degradation by introducing additional Gaussian blur, salt and pepper, and speckle noises to original images. Ten quality metrics are measured from each sample for classification between original and fake hand image. The classification experiments are performed using the k-nearest neighbors, random forest, and support vector machine classifiers, as well as deep convolutional neural networks. The proposed gradient similarity-based quality metric achieves 1.5% average classification error using the k-nearest neighbors and random forest classifiers. An average classification error of 2.5% is obtained using the baseline evaluation with the MobileNetV2 deep network for discriminating original and different types of fake hand samples.

To efficiently evaluate such videos, which are populated with both vehicles and pedestrians, it would be preferable to have one unified framework with effective performance across both domains. Unfortunately, due to the contrasting composition of humans and vehicles, no architecture has yet been established that can adequately perform both tasks. We release a Person and Vehicle Unified Data Set (PVUD) comprising of both pedestrians and vehicles from popular existing re-ID data sets, in order to better model the data that we would expect to find in the real world.

However, as these approaches exploit only one single server, they may face several performance issues related to server bottlenecks. Moreover, such schemes are found to be vulnerable to various active and passive security attacks. In this paper, we propose a privacy preserving, secure and efficient location sharing scheme for mOSNs, which shows both efficiency and flexibility in the location update, sharing, and query of social friends and social strangers. The security of the proposed scheme is validated using random oracle based formal security proof and Burrows-Abadi-Needham (BAN) logic based authentication proof, followed by informal security analysis. Additionally, we have used ProVerif 1.93 to verify the security of the system. The efficiency and practicability of the proposed scheme are demonstrated through experimental implementation and evaluation."

However, little e?ort has been made to tackle it. In this research, we first build a new database, i.e., Facial Beauty Database (FBD), which contains 17,866 paired facial images of 8,933 subjects without and with makeup in different real-world scenarios. To the best of our knowledge, FBD is the largest makeup face database to date compared with existing databases for facial makeup research. Moreover, we propose a new discriminative marginal metric learning (DMML) algorithm to deal with this problem in the wild. Inspired by the fact that interclass marginal faces are usually more discriminative than interclass nonmarginal faces in learning the discriminative metric space, we use the interclass marginal faces to depict the discriminative information. Simultaneously, we wish that those interclass marginal faces without makeup relations are separated from each other as far as possible, so that more discriminative information between facial images without and with makeup can be exploited for verification. Furthermore, since multiple features could provide comprehensive information in describing the facial representations from diverse points of view and extract more informative cues from facial images, we introduce a multiview discriminative marginal metric learning (MDMML) algorithm by effectively learning a robust metric space such that multiple features from different points of view can be integrated to effectively enhance the performance of makeup face verification. Experimental results on two real-world makeup face databases are utilized to show the effectiveness of our method and the possibility of verifying the makeup relations from facial images in real-world.

Biometric is one of the most trustworthy authenticators, and is presently being advocated to use in the remote authentication of TMIS. However, most of the existing TMISs consider a single-server-environment-based authentication system. Therefore, patients need to register and log into every server separately for different services. Furthermore, these schemes do not employ error correction technique to remove the errors from biometric data. Also, biometrics are inherent and demand diversification to generate a revocable template from inherent biometric data. In this paper, we propose a mutual authentication and key agreement scheme for a multi-medical server environment to overcome the limitations of the existing schemes. In the proposed scheme, a cancelable transformation of the raw biometric data is used to provide the privacy and the diversification of biometric data. The errors of the biometric data are corrected with error-correction techniques under the fuzzy commitment mechanism. Formal security analysis using the widely accepted Real-Or-Random (ROR) model, the Burrows-Abadi- Needham (BAN) logic and the Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications (AVISPA) tool concludes that the proposed scheme is safe against known attacks.

Second, we exploit channel attention via a squeeze and excitation unit in the backbone model to emphasise important features throughout all layers of the model. This ensures that the output feature vector is a better representation of the image, and is also more suitable to use within our dynamically weighted Euclidean distance function.

Motivated by the demand, we propose a lightweight method to automatically and efficiently beautify the shapes of both portrait and non-portrait faces in photos, while allowing users to customize the beautification of individual facial features. Previous methods focus on the beautification of mostly frontal and neutral faces, without incorporating user controllability in the beautification process. To address these restrictions, we propose the Facial Reshaping Operator representation, which is affine-invariant, captures the pairwise geometric configuration of facial landmarks, and allows for efficient face beautification with the user-specified weights of individual facial parts. We also propose an unsupervised beautification method in the operator space of faces, where an input face is iteratively pulled towards a local nearby density mode with improved attractiveness. Our method distinguishes itself from the commercial beautification tools in that it mildly enhances facial shapes without altering makeups or complexions, which complements these tools that lack fine-grained control on the attractiveness of facial shapes for users. The experimental results show that our method improves facial shape attractiveness for a large range of poses and expressions, demonstrating the potential of applicability to photos seen on the social media such as Facebook and Instagram everyday.

Due to this difficulty, state-of-the-art results are mostly reliant on the Face Parsing Algorithm, which segments a face into parts in order to easily extract makeup features. However, this algorithm can only work well on high-definition images where facial features can be accurately extracted. Faces in many real-world photos, such as those including a large background or multiple people, are typically of low-resolution, which considerably hinders state-of- the-art algorithms. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end holistic approach to effectively transfer makeup styles between two low-resolution images. The idea is built upon a novel weighted multi-scale spatial attention module, which identifies salient pixel regions on low-resolution images in multiple scales, and uses channel attention to determine the most effective attention map. This design provides two benefits: low-resolution images are usually blurry to different extents, so a multi-scale architecture can select the most effective convolution kernel size to implement spatial attention; makeup is applied on both a macro-level (foundation, fake tan) and a micro-level (eyeliner, lipstick) so different scales can excel in extracting different makeup features. We develop an Augmented CycleGAN network that embeds our attention modules at selected layers to most effectively transfer makeup. Our system is tested with the FBD data set, which consists of many low-resolution facial images, and demonstrate that it outperforms state-of-the-art methods, particularly in transferring makeup for blurry images and partially occluded images."

While recent works of pedestrian trajectory prediction successfully modelled the influence of surrounding neighbours based on the relative distances, they are ineffective on multi-class trajectory prediction. This is because they ignore the impact of the implicit correlations between different types of road users on the trajectory to be predicted - for example, a nearby pedestrian has a different level of influence from a nearby car. In this paper, we propose to introduce class information into a graph convolutional neural network to better predict the trajectory of an individual. We embed the class labels of the surrounding objects into the label adjacency matrix (LAM), which is combined with the velocity-based adjacency matrix (VAM) comprised of the objects' velocity, thereby generating a semantics-guided graph adjacency (SAM). SAM effectively models semantic information with trainable parameters to automatically learn the embedded label features that will contribute to the fixed velocity-based trajectory. Such information of spatial and temporal dependencies is passed to a graph convolutional and temporal convolutional network to estimate the predicted trajectory distributions. We further propose new metrics, known as Average2 Displacement Error (aADE) and Average Final Displacement Error (aFDE), that assess network accuracy more accurately. We call our framework Semantics-STGCNN. It consistently shows superior performance to the state-of-the-arts in existing and the newly proposed metrics."

We propose a path planning approach called the Flux Guided (FG) method, which generates collision-free trajectories while maximising the coverage of one or more targets. We show that by reformulating an existing least-squares flux minimisation problem as a constrained optimisation problem, the paths obtained are 1.5X shorter and track directly toward the target. Also, we demonstrate that the scale of the formation can be controlled during flight, and that this feature can be used to track multiple scattered targets. The method is highly scalable since the planning algorithm is only required for a sub-set of UAVs on the open boundary of the formation's surface. Finally, through simulating a 3d dynamic particle system that tracks the desired trajectories using a PID controller, we show that the resulting trajectories after time-optimal parameterisation are suitable for robotic controls."

In particular, we build a database with pairwise samples of gestures and crowd motions. To effectively generalize the gesture style of different users, such as the use of different numbers of fingers, we propose a set of gesture features for representing a set of hand gesture trajectories. Similarly, to represent crowd motion trajectories of different numbers of characters over time, we propose a set of crowd motion features that are extracted from a Gaussian mixture model. Given a run-time gesture, our system extracts the K nearest gestures from the database and interpolates the corresponding crowd motions in order to generate the run-time control.

The first part is an interactive tool that takes an overhead video as an input and tracks the pedestrians in a semi-automatic manner. The second part is a data-driven abnormal trajectories detection algorithm, which applies iterative k-means clustering to find out possible paths in the scene and thereby identifies those that do not fit well in any paths. Since the system requires only RGB video, it is compatible with most of the closed-circuit television (CCTV) systems used for security monitoring. Furthermore, the training of the abnormal trajectories detection algorithm is unsupervised and fully automatic. It means that the system can be deployed into a new location without manual parameter tuning and training data annotations.

Simple greedy crowd control methods easily lead to congestion at bottlenecks within scenes, as the characters do not cooperate with one another. In computer animation, this problem degrades crowd quality especially when ordered behaviour is needed, such as soldiers marching towards a castle. Similarly, in applications such as real-time strategy games, this often causes player frustration, as the crowd will not move as efficiently as it should. Also, planning of building would usually require visualization of ordered evacuation to maximize the flow. Planning such globally coordinated crowd movement is usually labour intensive. Here, we propose a simple solution that is easy to use and efficient in computation. First, we compute the harmonic field of the environment, taking into account the starting points, goals and obstacles. Based on the field, we represent the topology of the environment using a Reeb Graph, and calculate the maximum capacity for each path in the graph. With the harmonic field and the Reeb Graph, path planning of crowd can be performed using a lightweight algorithm, such that any blocking of one another??s paths is minimized. Comparing to previous methods, our system can synthesize globally coordinated crowd with smooth and efficient movement. It also enables control of the crowd with high-level parameters such as the degree of cooperation and congestion. Finally, the method is scalable to thousands of characters with minimal impact to computation time. It is best applied in interactive crowd synthesis systems such as animation designs and real-time strategy games.

Therefore, we simplify the problem by representing the crowd with a deformable mesh, and allow the user, via multi-touch input, to specify high level movements and formations that are important for context delivery. To help prevent congestion, our system dynamically reassigns characters in the formation by employing a mass transport solver to minimise their overall movement.

A typical BCI system uses different types of inputs; however, Electroencephalography (EEG) signals are most widely used due to their non-invasive EEG electrodes, portability, and cost efficiency. The signals generated by the brain while performing or imagining a motor related task (Motor Imagery (MI)) signals are one of the important inputs for BCI applications. EEG data is usually recorded from more than 100 locations across the brain, so efficient channel selection algorithms are of great importance to identify optimal channels related to a particular application. The main purpose of applying channel selection is to reduce computational complexity while analysing EEG signals, improve classification accuracy by reducing over-fitting, and decrease setup time. Different channel selection evaluation algorithms such as filtering, wrapper, and hybrid methods have been used for extracting optimal channel subsets by using predefined criteria. After extensively reviewing the literature in the field of EEG channel selection, we can conclude that channel selection algorithms provide a possibility to work with fewer channels without affecting the classification accuracy. In some cases, channel selection increases the system performance by removing the noisy channels. The research in the literature shows that the same performance can be achieved using a smaller channel set, with 10-30 channels in most cases.

This study targets the development of an intelligent mobile-based automatic diagnosis integrated with a microscopic lens to identify retinal diseases at initial stage at any time or place. Exudate detection is a significant step in order obtaining an early diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy, and if they are segmented accurately, laser treatment can be applied effectively. Consequently, precise segmentation is the fundamental step in exudate extraction. This paper proposes a technique for exudate segmentation in colour retinal images using morphological operations. In this method, after pre-processing, the optic disc and blood vessels are isolated from the retinal image. Exudates are then segmented by a combination of morphological operations such as the modified regionprops function and a reconstruction technique.

We propose a new framework that exploits the use of a motion-based feature known as optical flow extracted from the dash camera, and demonstrates that such a feature is effective in significantly improving the accuracy of the control signals. Our proposed framework involves two main components. The flow predictor, as a self-supervised deep network, models the underlying scene structure from consecutive frames and generates the optical flow. The controller, as a supervised multi-task deep network, predicts both steer angle and speed. We demonstrate that the proposed framework using the optical flow features can effectively predict control signals from a dash camera video. Using the Cityscapes dataset, we validate that the system prediction has errors as low as 0.0130 rad/s on steer angle and 0.0615 m/s on speed, outperforming existing research."

Shum"     "A Hybrid Metaheuristic Navigation Algorithm for Robot Path Rolling Planning in an Unknown Environment" "In this paper, a new method for robot path rolling planning in a static and unknown environment based on grid modelling is proposed. In an unknown scene, a local navigation optimization path for the robot is generated intelligently by ant colony optimization (ACO) combined with the environment information of robot’s local view and target information. The robot plans a new navigation path dynamically after certain steps along the previous local navigation path, and always moves along the optimized navigation path which is dynamically modified. The robot will move forward to the target point directly along the local optimization path when the target is within the current view of the robot. This method presents a more intelligent sub-goal mapping method comparing to the traditional rolling window approach. Besides, the path that is part of the generated local path based on the ACO between the current position and the next position of the robot is further optimized using particle swarm optimization (PSO), which resulted in a hybrid metaheuristic algorithm that incorporates ACO and PSO. Simulation results show that the robot can reach the target grid along a global optimization path without collision."

Given a reference motion of the robot and the corresponding environment configuration, the spatial relationships between the robot body parts and the environment objects are extracted as a representation called the Interaction Mesh. Such a representation is then used in adapting the reference motion to an altered environment. By preserving the spatial relationships while satisfying physical constraints, collision-free and well balanced motions can be generated automatically and efficiently. Experimental results show that the proposed method can adapt different full body motions in significantly modified environments. Our method can be applied in precise robotic controls under complicated environments, such as rescue robots in accident scenes and searching robots in highly constrained spaces."

Source controllers are created by gradually updating the task parameter such as the external force applied to the body. During the optimization, instead of only saving the optimal controllers, we also keep a large number of non-optimal controllers. These controllers provide knowledge about the stable area in the controller space, and are then used as samples to construct a low dimensional manifold that represents stable controllers. During runtime, we interpolate controllers in the low dimensional space and create stable controllers to cope with the irregular external forces. Our method is best to be applied for real-time applications such as computer games."

Traditional fuzzy inference systems are only applicable to problems with dense rule bases covering the entire problem domains, whilst fuzzy rule interpolation (FRI) works with sparse rule bases that do not cover certain inputs. Thanks to its ability to work with a rule base with less number of rules, FRI approaches have been utilised as a means to reduce system complexity for complex fuzzy models. This is implemented by removing the rules that can be approximated by their neighbours. Most of the existing fuzzy rule base generation and simplification approaches only target dense rule bases for traditional fuzzy inference systems. This paper proposes a new sparse fuzzy rule base generation method to support FRI. In particular, this approach uses curvature values to identify important rules that cannot be accurately approximated by their neighbouring ones for initialising a compact rule base. The initialised rule base is then optimised using an optimisation algorithm by fine-tuning the membership functions of the involved fuzzy sets. Experiments with a simulation model and a real-world application demonstrate the working principle and the actual performance of the proposed system, with results comparable to the traditional methods using rule bases with more rules.

Shum" "Ling Shao"     "Manifold Regularized Experimental Design for Active Learning" "Various machine learning and data mining tasks in classification require abundant data samples to be labeled for training. Conventional active learning methods aim at labeling the most informative samples for alleviating the labor of the user. Many previous studies in active learning select one sample after another in a greedy manner. However, this is not very effective because the classification models have to be retrained for each newly labeled sample. Moreover, many popular active learning approaches utilize the most uncertain samples by leveraging the classification hyperplane of the classifier, which is not appropriate since the classification hyperplane is inaccurate when the training data are small-sized. The problem of insufficient training data in real-world systems limits the potential applications of these approaches. This paper presents a novel method of active learning called manifold regularized experimental design (MRED), which can label multiple informative samples at one time for training. In addition, MRED gives an explicit geometric explanation for the selected samples to be labeled by the user. Different from existing active learning methods, our method avoids the intrinsic problems caused by insufficiently labeled samples in real-world applications. Various experiments on synthetic datasets, the Yale face database and the Corel image database have been carried out to show how MRED outperforms existing methods."

Shum" "Ling Shao"     "Discriminative Semantic Subspace Analysis for Relevance Feedback" "Content-based image retrieval (CBIR) has attracted much attention during the past decades for its potential practical applications to image database management. A variety of relevance feedback (RF) schemes have been designed to bridge the gap between low-level visual features and high-level semantic concepts for an image retrieval task. In the process of RF, it would be impractical or too expensive to provide explicit class label information for each image. Instead, similar or dissimilar pairwise constraints between two images can be acquired more easily. However, most of the conventional RF approaches can only deal with training images with explicit class label information. In this paper, we propose a novel discriminative semantic subspace analysis (DSSA) method, which can directly learn a semantic subspace from similar and dissimilar pairwise constraints without using any explicit class label information. In particular, DSSA can effectively integrate the local geometry of labeled similar images, the discriminative information between labeled similar and dissimilar images, and the local geometry of labeled and unlabeled images together to learn a reliable subspace. Compared with the popular distance metric analysis approaches, our method can also learn a distance metric but perform more effectively when dealing with high-dimensional images. Extensive experiments on both the synthetic data sets and a real-world image database demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme in improving the performance of the CBIR."

Compared to the Mamdani approach, the TSK approach is more convenient when the crisp outputs are required. Common to both approaches, when a given observation does not overlap with any rule antecedent in the rule base (which usually termed as a sparse rule base), no rule can be fired, and thus no result can be generated. Fuzzy rule interpolation was proposed to address such issue. Although a number of important fuzzy rule interpolation approaches have been proposed in the literature, all of them were developed for Mamdani inference approach, which leads to the fuzzy outputs. This paper extends the traditional TSK fuzzy inference approach to allow inferences on sparse TSK fuzzy rule bases with crisp outputs directly generated. This extension firstly calculates the similarity degrees between a given observation and every individual rule in the rule base, such that the similarity degrees between the observation and all rule antecedents are greater than 0 even when they do not overlap. Then the TSK fuzzy model is extended using the generated matching degrees to derive crisp inference results. The experimentation shows the promising of the approach in enhancing the TSK inference engine when the knowledge represented in the rule base is not complete."
